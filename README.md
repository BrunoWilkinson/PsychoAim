Simple aim warm up game, just click on the surrounding targets without getting touch by them, or otherwise you have to start back to wave 1!

Try to beat your best score! But the real goal of the game is to warm up before playing your favourite FPS game and start popping!

If you have any suggestions add them in the comment section below, I'm open to feedback!

Controls:

- Aim with mouse (of course)

- WASD or Arrows key to move around

- Space bar to Jump

Thank you for playing!
