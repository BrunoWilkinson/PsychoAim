Simple aim warmup game, just click on the targets around you without getting touch by them or otherwise you have to start back to wave 1!

Try to beat your best score! But the real goal of the game is to warmup before playing your favourite FPS game and start popping!

If you have any suggestions add them in the comment section below, I'm open to feedback!

Controls:

- Aim with mouse (of course)

- WASD or Arrows key to move around

- Space bar to Jump

Thank you for playing!
