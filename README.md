# PsychoAim

This is an alpha build, the core mechanics are there, down the line I will add better visuals, sounds, and more mechanics such as poweups, timers, ect...

Also will add more in depth settings for crosshair and sensitivty!

If you have any suggestions add them in the comment section below, I'm open to feedback!

Simple aim warmup game, just click on the targets around you without getting touch by them or otherwise you have to start back to wave 1!

Try to beat your best score! But the real goal of the game is to warmup before playing your favourite FPS game and start popping!

Controls:

- Aim with mouse (of course)

- WASD or Arrows key to move around

- Space bar to Jump

Thank you for playing!
